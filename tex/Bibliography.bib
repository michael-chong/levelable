@article{Baker2016,
abstract = {Let {\$}G{\$} be a vertex decomposable graph. Inspired by a conjecture of Villarreal, we investigate when {\$}{\{}\backslashrm Shed{\}}(G){\$}, the set of shedding vertices of {\$}G{\$}, forms a dominating set in the graph {\$}G{\$}. We show that this property holds for many known families of vertex decomposable graphs. A computer search shows that this property holds for all vertex decomposable graphs on eight or less vertices. However, there are vertex decomposable graphs on nine or more vertices for which {\$}{\{}\backslashrm Shed{\}}(G){\$} is not a dominating set. We describe three new infinite families of vertex decomposable graphs, each with the property that {\$}{\{}\backslashrm Shed{\}}(G){\$} is not a dominating set.},
