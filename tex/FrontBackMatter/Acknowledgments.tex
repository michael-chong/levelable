\chapter*{Acknowledgements}


My sincere thanks to my supervisor, Dr. Adam Van Tuyl, for his patience and guidance in this past year. Through this project he has enabled my growth as a mathematician, and I hope the text that follows reflects his exceptional teaching.

\bigskip
\noindent
I would also like to acknowledge my peers in the Integrated Science class of 2018 who have simultaneously been my colleagues, friends, and mentors at McMaster.

\bigskip
\noindent
To my friends in the Mathematics concentration, your acknowledgements are left as an exercise for the reader.
