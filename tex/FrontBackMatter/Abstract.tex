\chapter*{Abstract}
In commutative algebra, the Stanley-Reisner ideal allows for the construction of an artinian quotient ring (Stanley-Reisner ring) from a simplicial complex. Given some simplicial complex, it is sometimes possible to make a level artinian ring by adjoining powers of the variables as generators to the Stanley-Reisner ideal. In the cases where such a choice of powers exists, we call the simplicial complex â€œlevelable". In this project, we discuss the case where the simplicial complex is the independence complex of a graph. That is, what graphs have an independence complex that can produce level rings through this construction? We investigate this question using a computer script in SageMath, and enumerate levelable graphs up to 10 vertices. We present families of graphs that satisfy and do not have the levelable property, and discuss graph operations that preserve and destroy this property.
