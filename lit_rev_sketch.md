    + start off with the Wikipedia page maybe
    + Hilbert Function of a Level algebra

    
## Definitions
### from ring theory + algebra
* ring
    + polynomial rings
    + homogeneous polynomial
* ideals (are special subrings of R -- analagous to normal subgroups in group theory)
    + homogeneous ideals (generated by homog. elements)
* quotient ring
* grading of quotient rings
    + leading to level algebras

### from simplicial complex
* simplicial complexes
    + facets, faces, pure
* independence complex

### from graph theory
* what is a graph?
* independence complex
* other terminology

## Stanley-Reisner rings
