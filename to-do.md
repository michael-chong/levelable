## Jan. 5 Meeting
* made the suggested edits to the literature review
* started a new doc

* chapters for new doc?
    + Title page, table of contents
    + Abstract
    + Introduction (explain the problem)

    + Definitions (give necessary background)
        + Here include proof of disconnected graphs
    + Background results (maybe merge with above)
        +
        + include proofs
        + talk about how these results translate into the independence complex problem

    + SageMath (and associated results)
        + smallest example of not levelable
        + "atlas"
        + if number of not levelable is small, display them all
    + Results on different classes of graphs
        + Large cycles
        + Long paths?
        + failed conjectures/interesting examples (e.g subgraph thing)
    + Conjectures (and reasoning/evidence for conjectures), & summary, conclusion?
    + Appendix (with code)
    + Bibliography

* next things to do?
    + settle on a template
    + prove long paths, stars, and "connected stars"
    + if and only if statement for disconnected
    + continue looking for conjectures?
        + think of graph operations (e.g. adding a vertex connected to all existing graphs)
        + subgraphs

* deadlines
    + up to Feb 2: focus on results section
    + February: polish up, writing
    + March 2: draft of thesis (for peer review)
    + March 7: peer reviews due
    + March 12: draft due to supervisor
    + March 26 - April 6: Oral presentations
    + April 9: Thesis due

* send results to Adam as they come
